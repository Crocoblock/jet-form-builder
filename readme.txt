Advanced form builder plugin for Gutenberg. Create forms from the ground up, customize the existing ones, and style them up – all in one editor.

== Description ==

**JetFormBuilder — Form Builder plugin for Gutenberg**

A functional yet handy Form Builder plugin that lets you create, edit, and style any form type in the Gutenberg Editor. No more supplementary drag-and-drop form builders. You can now use a one-stop interface to develop a fully operative form.

JetFormBuilder allows you to build any kind of form nice and easy. Its 18 field blocks allow you to create a form from scratch or reassemble the existing one. Throw JetStyleManager into the mix and you’ll be able to style every form field. Create, customize, and style – all in Gutenberg.

**Integrations**

**<a href="https://crocoblock.com/plugins/jetengine/?utm_source=facebook_community&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=jetformbuilder_plugin&utm_content=demo_release" target="_blank">JetEngine</a>**
Use the JetEngine potential when developing a Gutenberg form. You can add meta fields and custom taxonomies to the JetFormBuilder fields, generate the field values dynamically, and put the JetEngine-built custom post types into the dynamic settings. 

**<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jet-style-manager/">JetStyleManager</a>**
We added the opportunity to change the way Gutenberg Form blocks will look on the frontend. You can style up every component separately. Just hit the brush icon and do the necessary styling in the Block Style section.   

More third-party plugin integrations are in the works.
